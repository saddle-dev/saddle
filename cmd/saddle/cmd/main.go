Users supply configuration data provided by libraries and validated against
schemas. saddle will then generate the files in the correct format.

saddle makes it simple to manage configuration for multiple tools and apply
them consistently across one to many repositories.

For more information on using saddle to manage code see saddle.dev.`,
